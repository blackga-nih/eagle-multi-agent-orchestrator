# Memo: Where We Stand on `/kb-regenerate`

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Author:** Black (with Claude)
**Audience:** EAGLE team
**TL;DR:** The `/kb-regenerate` command exists, works, and is the only thing keeping our KB metadata, checklists, templates, and compliance matrix from silently drifting. It is **not wired into CI** — it only runs when a human invokes the slash command in Claude Code. There is also a bigger problem behind it: KB content authority is split across three buckets (`rh-eagle-files`, `eagle-documents-…/eagle-knowledge-base/`, and the S3 Vectors index `rh-eagle/eagle-kb-approved`), with a measured ~84-doc drift between the source and the dest bucket and **no production runtime code that writes vectors**. We need to (a) close the immediate drift, (b) extend `/kb-regenerate` to validate the vector-side of that pipeline, and (c) decide whether vectors become the canonical retrieval lane.

> **Update — same day, 2026-04-29 PM (post-write):** Several memo claims have already been overtaken by work in progress on `fix/semantic-lane-iam-titan-embed`. (1) The semantic lane wasn't just stale — it was returning `[]` on every call due to a missing `bedrock:InvokeModel` grant on `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2`; fixed in commit `f41847a` (15:06 EDT). (2) A new env-scoped vectors bucket name has been chosen — `eagle-kb-vectors-{account}-{env}` — wired into `environments.ts` and the ECS task env (`S3_VECTORS_BUCKET` / `S3_VECTORS_INDEX`); bucket is created **manually via AWS CLI** because S3 Vectors lacks CDK L2 constructs. (3) `storage-stack.ts` now adds an explicit `DenyKnowledgeBaseWrites` IAM statement — runtime agent can never `Put`/`Delete` under `eagle-knowledge-base/*`, codifying KB ingestion as Lambda + operator-script only. (4) `scripts/migrate-knowledge-base.py` is moving to `scripts/archive/migrate-knowledge-base.py` (not lost). (5) Separate retrieval-quality fix in flight: `_FORCED_AGENT_ROUTES` + keyword expansion in `strands_agentic_service.py` to address the Q4/Q5 Part-15 misroute on SBIR / IDIQ-Part-16 queries. Treat the open architectural decisions below as partially resolved — sections #1 (canonical bucket) and #3 (runtime never writes) are decided.

## What it is

A Claude Code slash command at `.claude/commands/kb-regenerate.md`, introduced in commit **a522b2d** (2026-04-03) and last updated in **eff6b45** (2026-04-27, Alvee's KB v3 path fix). It runs up to five phases:

| Phase | Purpose | What it touches |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| 1. Orphan purge | Scan `eagle-document-metadata-dev`, head-check each `s3_key`, delete entries whose S3 object is gone | DynamoDB |
| 2. Checklist + template validation | `head_object` every checklist (9) and template (11) the backend hardcodes against | S3 only — read |
| 3. Compliance matrix deep analysis | `scripts/kb_matrix_analysis.py` — three layers: matrix.json internal consistency, backend `compliance_matrix.py` sync, frontend `matrix-data.ts` sync (Ctrl+M modal) | Source files only — read |
| 4. Metadata regeneration | Optional, behind `--regenerate <key>` or `--regenerate-all`. Invokes `eagle-metadata-extractor-dev` Lambda asynchronously per S3 object | Lambda + DynamoDB |
| 5. Summary report | Consolidated PASS/FAIL table | stdout only |

Default invocation runs Phases 1–3 + 5. Phase 4 is opt-in.

## How to invoke

From inside Claude Code (any session in this repo):

```text
/kb-regenerate                          # full hygiene run (dry orphan delete OFF — will purge)
/kb-regenerate --dry-run                # report only, deletes nothing
/kb-regenerate --regenerate <s3-key>    # re-extract metadata for one document
/kb-regenerate --regenerate-all         # re-extract metadata for every doc under approved/
```

It needs the `eagle` AWS SSO profile (us-east-1, account 695681773636 / NONPROD). The command body uses inline `python -c "..."` blocks invoked via Bash, so any environment that can run `boto3` against the dev account works.

## Is it wired up?

**No** — not in the way "wired up" usually means.

- ❌ Not in `.github/workflows/` — no scheduled or PR-triggered run.
- ❌ Not in `Justfile` — no `just kb-regenerate` recipe.
- ❌ Not in `server/app/` — no API endpoint.
- ❌ Not in the deploy pipeline — `deploy.yml` does not gate on KB integrity.
- ✅ Referenced in two docs: the KB v2 migration plan (`docs/20260413-100000-plan-kb-v2-migration-v1.md`, Phase 4 step 8) and the weekly changelog. Both treat it as a manual cleanup step.
- ✅ The Phase 3 helper (`scripts/kb_matrix_analysis.py`) is a standalone Python script — runnable without Claude.

In practice that means the only way it executes today is when a developer remembers to type `/kb-regenerate` in their Claude session. That is fine for the orphan-purge phase (destructive, wants a human), but Phases 2 and 3 are pure validators and should arguably run on every PR that touches `eagle-plugin/data/matrix.json`, `compliance_matrix.py`, `template_registry.py`, `knowledge_tools.py`, or `matrix-data.ts`.

## Recent commits that bear on whether the command needs enhancement

| Commit | Date | Why it matters |
|--------|------|---------------|
| `a522b2d` | 2026-04-03 | Created `/kb-regenerate` and `kb_matrix_analysis.py`. Established the 5-phase shape. |
| `af83106` | 2026-04-02 | Compliance matrix Phases 2e–6 landed: `_CONFIDENCE`, `_extract_far_citations`, `_verify`, `get_template_fields`, `_related_far`. **Phase 3 of kb-regenerate does not yet check confidence-dict consistency or `_verify` output shape.** |
| `e39b567` | 2026-04-09 (est.) | Added new matrix keys: `intake_required_facts`, `budget_semantics`. **Phase 3 layer-A does not yet validate these new top-level keys.** |
| `e12fcdd` / `d14a41d` | mid-Apr | Tier compliance docs (core vs supplemental). New schema fields under `doc_rules`. **Layer A check should grow accordingly.** |
| `7ebbf7a` | mid-Apr | Semantic retrieval Lane 1e (S3 Vectors + Titan v2). **Nothing in kb-regenerate validates vector index sync against `eagle-documents` bucket — when a doc is deleted from S3, its vector lingers.** |
| `eff6b45` | 2026-04-27 | KB v3 path migration. Hardcoded paths in kb-regenerate's CHECKLISTS / TEMPLATES lists had to be hand-edited in lockstep with `knowledge_tools.py:BUILTIN_KB_ENTRIES`. **This is a maintenance smell — both lists are duplicates of the same source of truth.** |
| `cf0d3bb` / `8213928` | 2026-04-26 → 2026-04-28 | Per-lane source transparency + lane breakdown modal. Adds new SSE wire-shape (`lane`, `score`, `lane_breakdown`). Surface area where matrix→frontend drift would now be user-visible. |

## Bigger picture: the S3 Vectors / canonical-source problem

Investigation today (separate Claude session, verified against the live AWS account) surfaced a structural issue that the current `/kb-regenerate` does not catch. KB content authority is split across **three buckets that no production code keeps in sync**:

```
rh-eagle-files                                 ← manually edited, 343 objects
        │  (one-time copy via scripts/migrate-knowledge-base.py,
        │   tracked in git but currently deleted on this branch
        │   and known stale — 84-doc drift)
        ▼
eagle-documents-{acct}-{env}/                  ← 259 objects (last write 2026-04-28)
   eagle-knowledge-base/approved/
        │  (read by the metadata + path retrieval lanes via
        │   knowledge_tools.py; written manually only)
        ▼
rh-eagle/eagle-kb-approved (S3 Vectors index)  ← STATIC. Seeded externally.
                                                  Queried by Lane 1e (semantic).
                                                  No in-app PutVectors anywhere.
```

Specifically:
- **`scripts/migrate-knowledge-base.py`** (committed in `27ce3bc`, 2026-03-04) is the one-shot batch that copies `rh-eagle-files` → `eagle-documents-…/eagle-knowledge-base/`. It is currently *deleted in the working tree on `fix/semantic-lane-iam-titan-embed`* — visible via `git status` — which means anyone branching from there loses the migration tool. The drift is real: **84 docs (~25%) live on the source but not the dest.**
- **`server/scripts/backfill_s3_vectors.py`** (committed in `664dfa7`, mid-Apr) is the matching one-shot for vectors — chunks docs, embeds via Bedrock Titan v2, upserts into `rh-eagle/eagle-kb-approved`. Idempotent, but **manual**. There is no `PutVectors` anywhere in `server/app/` runtime code.
- The metadata-extraction Lambda exists at `infrastructure/cdk-eagle/lambda/metadata-extraction/` (writes DynamoDB, **not vectors**). To make vectors update automatically on doc upload, this Lambda would need an embed step bolted on.

**Net effect:** today, retrieval freshness on the semantic lane depends entirely on whoever last ran `backfill_s3_vectors.py`, and we don't have telemetry telling us when that was. The metadata/path lanes depend on whoever last ran `migrate-knowledge-base.py`. Both are invisible to `/kb-regenerate` Phase 1's orphan purge, which only checks DynamoDB ↔ `eagle-documents` consistency.

### Architectural decisions still open

1. **Canonical source bucket.** Pick one — `eagle-knowledge-base-{account}-{env}` (env-scoped, matches our convention) or one bucket with `pending/`/`approved/` prefixes mirroring the metadata-extraction Lambda's S3-event shape.
2. **Reprocess execution model.** Drop-and-trigger via S3 event → Lambda (embeds + writes vectors + moves to `approved/`), or scheduled daily re-embed job over the source bucket.
3. **Retrieval architecture.** Vectors as primary with metadata/path as fallback, or full cutover? And do agent-prompt files (`approved/agents/02-legal.txt`, fetched directly by S3 key via `knowledge_fetch`) move to vectors too, or stay direct-fetch?
4. **Migration sequence.** One-shot cutover, or run vectors alongside the existing lanes for a sprint?

These belong in a proper plan spec — not this memo — but `/kb-regenerate` enhancements should anticipate the answer.

## Suggested enhancements (rough priority order)

1. **De-duplicate the checklist + template lists.** Phase 2 hardcodes 9 checklists and 11 templates. The same lists live in `server/app/tools/knowledge_tools.py` (`BUILTIN_KB_ENTRIES`) and `server/app/template_registry.py` (`TEMPLATE_REGISTRY`). Have Phase 2 import from those modules instead. KB v3 only had to touch four files because of this duplication; next migration shouldn't.
2. **Teach Phase 3 about new matrix keys.** Add Layer-A validators for `intake_required_facts` and `budget_semantics` (commit `e39b567`), and core-vs-supplemental tier fields (commit `e12fcdd`).
3. **Add a Phase 3D: `_CONFIDENCE` and `_verify` shape check.** Confirm every doc/compliance/approval entry in `get_requirements()` output carries a `confidence` field (Phase 6 from the matrix overhaul) and that `_verify.far_citations` is non-empty when applicable. Could be a 30-line property-style assertion.
4. **New Phase 6 — three-bucket sync audit.** This is the big one. The phase should:
   - Diff `rh-eagle-files` ↔ `eagle-documents-…/eagle-knowledge-base/approved/` and report the drift count + missing keys (today: 343 vs 259 = 84 missing).
   - Diff S3 keys ↔ S3 Vectors index entries in `rh-eagle/eagle-kb-approved` and flag (a) orphan vectors whose source doc is gone and (b) source docs with no vector entry.
   - Surface the **last-modified timestamp** of the most recent vector upsert, since today we have no signal on vector freshness.
   - All read-only — never auto-purges vectors. Bumping is a separate, opt-in action.
5. **New flag `--reembed <s3-key>` / `--reembed-all`.** Wraps `server/scripts/backfill_s3_vectors.py`, mirroring how Phase 4 wraps the metadata Lambda. Gives us one consistent tool for "make the indexes match the source."
6. **New flag `--migrate-source` (or wrap the existing script).** Makes `scripts/migrate-knowledge-base.py` invocable from inside `/kb-regenerate` so it stops being an undiscoverable, sometimes-deleted file. Also: get that script restored on this branch and committed back to main so it doesn't disappear again.
7. **De-duplicate the checklist + template lists.** Phase 2 hardcodes 9 checklists and 11 templates. The same lists live in `server/app/tools/knowledge_tools.py` (`BUILTIN_KB_ENTRIES`) and `server/app/template_registry.py` (`TEMPLATE_REGISTRY`). Have Phase 2 import from those modules instead. KB v3 only had to touch four files because of this duplication; next migration shouldn't.
8. **Teach Phase 3 about new matrix keys.** Add Layer-A validators for `intake_required_facts` and `budget_semantics` (commit `e39b567`), and core-vs-supplemental tier fields (commit `e12fcdd`).
9. **Add a Phase 3D: `_CONFIDENCE` and `_verify` shape check.** Confirm every doc/compliance/approval entry in `get_requirements()` output carries a `confidence` field (Phase 6 from the matrix overhaul) and that `_verify.far_citations` is non-empty when applicable. Could be a 30-line property-style assertion.
10. **Wire Phases 2, 3, and 6-audit into CI.** They are read-only and fast. Make a `just kb-validate` recipe that runs them, plus a GitHub Action that runs on PRs touching the trigger files. The drift number + vector-staleness number become PR comments. Phases 1, 4, 5, and 6 stay manual / opt-in.
11. **Add a `--qa` / `--prod` flag.** Hardcoded constants reference `eagle-document-metadata-dev` and `eagle-documents-695681773636-dev`. QA and prod accounts will need their own values; today the command can only target dev.

## Recommended next action

Two parallel tracks:

**Track A — close immediate drift (today / tomorrow).**
1. Restore `scripts/migrate-knowledge-base.py` on this branch (`git checkout HEAD -- scripts/migrate-knowledge-base.py`) so it isn't lost.
2. Run `/kb-regenerate --dry-run` against dev to baseline orphan count and surface any KB v3 path issues we missed.
3. Run `scripts/migrate-knowledge-base.py` (manually for now) to close the 84-doc gap between source and dest.
4. Run `server/scripts/backfill_s3_vectors.py` to refresh the vector index against the post-migration `eagle-documents` corpus.

**Track B — write the architecture pivot plan.** Open `.claude/specs/{ts}-plan-vectors-as-canonical-retrieval-v1.md` capturing the four open architectural decisions above. Decide whether vectors become primary retrieval and whether the metadata-extraction Lambda absorbs an embed step, before we commit to enhancement #4 (Phase 6 audit) and #5/#6 (re-embed / migrate flags) on `/kb-regenerate`. Those enhancements need to know what the steady-state pipeline looks like.
