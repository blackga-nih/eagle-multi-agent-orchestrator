# Tech Review Skill

Validate technical requirements, specifications, and ensure compliance with accessibility and technical standards.

## Core Functions

### 1. Specification Validation
Review technical specifications for completeness, clarity, and compliance.

### 2. Installation Requirements
Verify installation, integration, and site preparation needs are documented.

### 3. Training & Support Review
Ensure adequate training and support requirements are included.

### 4. Accessibility Compliance
Verify Section 508 and accessibility requirements.

- Unnecessarily narrow specifications
- Requiring features not needed for mission

**FAR Reference:** FAR 11.002 - Use functional/performance specs

#### Ambiguous Requirements
- Subjective terms: "state-of-the-art," "best available"
- Undefined acronyms or technical terms
- Missing quantitative criteria

#### Missing Information
- No acceptance criteria
- Unclear deliverables
- Missing interface specifications
