### Next Steps

Your package is almost complete! You just need the J&A document.

Since you indicated Illumina is the only source, use:
`/document ja`

I'll use FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source) as the authority.
```

### Example 2: No Active Intake
```
User: /status

EAGLE: 
You don't have an active intake session.

To start a new acquisition request, use:
`/intake`

Or describe your need:
`/intake I need to purchase lab equipment`
```

### Example 3: Complete Package
```
User: /status

EAGLE:
